# Daisy Risk Engine

## Overview

The **Daisy Risk Engine** is a comprehensive **quantitative risk management platform** designed to evaluate and optimize portfolio performance. It computes both **realized** and **forecasted metrics**, performs **factor exposure analysis**, and enables **volatility-based sizing** for the portfolio. 

The engine is modular, and you can run the following components independently:

1. **Full Pipeline**: Runs the entire pipeline (realized + forecast + factor exposure + stress testing) in the correct dependency order.
2. **Risk Analysis**: Computes the realized and forecasted risk metrics only (no stress testing).
3. **Factor Exposure**: Analyzes the exposure to different factors and computes the factor returns.
4. **Stress Testing**: Runs factor exposure first, then comprehensive stress tests (historical scenarios, Monte Carlo, factor stress, regime analysis).

The system is designed for portfolio managers and quantitative risk analysts to **interact with data**, **adjust risk parameters**, and **visualize** various financial metrics through an intuitive **Streamlit** dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Realized Risk Metrics**: 
  - Compute **annual returns**, **volatility**, **max drawdown**, and other risk metrics like **VaR** (Value-at-Risk) and **CVaR** (Conditional Value-at-Risk).
  
- **Forecast Risk**: 
  - Utilizes **EWMA**, **GARCH**, and **EGARCH** models to predict risk metrics like **VaR**, **CVaR**, and forecasted volatility.

- **Factor Exposure Analysis**: 
  - Assess the portfolioâ€™s exposure to various factors like **Market**, **Volatility**, **Momentum**, **Size**, etc.

- **Volatility-Based Sizing**: 
  - Adjust portfolio positions based on **volatility forecasts**, ensuring that more volatile assets have lower weight.

- **ðŸ§ª Stress Testing**: 
  - **Historical Scenario Analysis**: Test against major market events (2008 Crisis, 2020 COVID, 2022 Inflation, etc.)
  - **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Advanced simulations with fat-tailed distributions (configurable 10,000+ simulations)
  - **Factor-Based Stress Tests**: Test sensitivity to factor shocks (Tech crash, rate spikes, volatility explosion, etc.)
  - **Regime-Dependent Analysis**: Adaptive testing based on current market conditions

- **Thematic and Proxy Management**: 
  - Define and adjust **themes** and **proxies** to guide stock selection and factor analysis.

## Architecture

### Modular Design

The **Daisy Risk Engine** is composed of several independent, modular components. Each module performs a specific task in the risk analysis pipeline. These modules include:

1. **Portfolio Loading**: 
   - Loads portfolio positions (tickers, weights, market values) from an **Excel file**.
   
2. **Price Data**: 
   - Downloads historical price data for each asset (and associated proxies) from **Yahoo Finance**.
   
3. **Realized Metrics Calculation**: 
   - Computes realized metrics, including annualized return, volatility, and other performance/risk metrics.

4. **Forecast Risk Calculation**: 
   - Computes forecasted risk metrics such as **VaR**, **CVaR**, and **volatility** using advanced models like **EWMA**, **GARCH**, and **EGARCH**.

5. **Factor Exposure and Returns**: 
   - Measures the portfolio's sensitivity to various factors (e.g., market, volatility, size, etc.) and computes factor exposures.

6. **Volatility-Based Sizing**: 
   - Adjusts portfolio positions based on forecasted volatility to better balance risk exposure.

### Streamlit Dashboard

The **Streamlit** dashboard is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for controlling the risk engine pipeline and visualizing results. Users can:

- **Run Pipeline Components**: Execute the full pipeline or specific components (risk analysis, factor exposure, or stress testing).
- **View Metrics**: View both realized and forecasted metrics, factor exposures, portfolio sizing, and comprehensive stress test results.
- **Visualize Results**: Explore various interactive **charts**, **graphs**, and **tables** to make data-driven decisions.
- **Static Tab Structure**: Clean, simple interface with 7 tabs: Realized Risk, Forecast Risk, Factor Exposure, Stress Testing, Volatility-Based Sizing, Themes & Proxies, and Reconstructed Prices.

    ### Portfolio Excel File Configuration:
    - **Path**: Specify the path to the Excel file in `config.yaml`.
    - **Named Ranges**: Define the named ranges for **tickers**, **weights**, and **market values**. These ranges should be a row or column vector with matching dimensions.

    Example configuration:
    ```yaml
    excel_path: ../Portfolio.xlsm  # Path to the portfolio Excel file
    sheet_name: Dashboard  # Name of the sheet containing portfolio data
    named_ranges:

    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    Start the app using Streamlit:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. **Running the pipeline**:
    - From the **Streamlit interface**, you can choose to run the full pipeline or specific components (`full`, `risk`, `factor`, or `stress`).
    - **User Settings**: Configure years of history, risk-free rate, random seed, Monte Carlo simulations, and total returns preference.
