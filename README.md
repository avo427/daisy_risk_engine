# Daisy Risk Engine

## Overview

The **Daisy Risk Engine** is a comprehensive **quantitative risk management platform** designed to evaluate and optimize portfolio performance. It computes both **realized** and **forecasted metrics**, performs **factor exposure analysis**, and enables **volatility-based sizing** for the portfolio. 

The engine is modular, and you can run the following components independently:

1. **Full Pipeline**: Runs the entire pipeline, including risk analysis and factor exposure.
2. **Risk Analysis**: Computes the realized and forecasted risk metrics.
3. **Factor Exposure**: Analyzes the exposure to different factors and computes the factor returns.

The system is designed for portfolio managers and quantitative risk analysts to **interact with data**, **adjust risk parameters**, and **visualize** various financial metrics through an intuitive **Streamlit** dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Realized Risk Metrics**: 
  - Compute **annual returns**, **volatility**, **max drawdown**, and other risk metrics like **VaR** (Value-at-Risk) and **CVaR** (Conditional Value-at-Risk).
  
- **Forecast Risk**: 
  - Utilizes **EWMA**, **GARCH**, and **EGARCH** models to predict risk metrics like **VaR**, **CVaR**, and forecasted volatility.

- **Factor Exposure Analysis**: 
  - Assess the portfolioâ€™s exposure to various factors like **Market**, **Volatility**, **Momentum**, **Size**, etc.

- **Volatility-Based Sizing**: 
  - Adjust portfolio positions based on **volatility forecasts**, ensuring that more volatile assets have lower weight.

- **Thematic and Proxy Management**: 
  - Define and adjust **themes** and **proxies** to guide stock selection and factor analysis.

## Architecture

### Modular Design

The **Daisy Risk Engine** is composed of several independent, modular components. Each module performs a specific task in the risk analysis pipeline. These modules include:

1. **Portfolio Loading**: 
   - Loads portfolio positions (tickers, weights, market values) from an **Excel file**.
   
2. **Price Data**: 
   - Downloads historical price data for each asset (and associated proxies) from **Yahoo Finance**.
   
3. **Realized Metrics Calculation**: 
   - Computes realized metrics, including annualized return, volatility, and other performance/risk metrics.

4. **Forecast Risk Calculation**: 
   - Computes forecasted risk metrics such as **VaR**, **CVaR**, and **volatility** using advanced models like **EWMA**, **GARCH**, and **EGARCH**.

5. **Factor Exposure and Returns**: 
   - Measures the portfolio's sensitivity to various factors (e.g., market, volatility, size, etc.) and computes factor exposures.

6. **Volatility-Based Sizing**: 
   - Adjusts portfolio positions based on forecasted volatility to better balance risk exposure.

### Streamlit Dashboard

The **Streamlit** dashboard is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for controlling the risk engine pipeline and visualizing results. Users can:

- **Run Pipeline Components**: Execute the full pipeline or specific components like risk analysis or factor exposure.
- **View Metrics**: View both realized and forecasted metrics, factor exposures, and portfolio sizing.
- **Visualize Results**: Explore various interactive **charts**, **graphs**, and **tables** to make data-driven decisions.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to install and run the **Daisy Risk Engine**:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd daisy_risk_engine
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure `config.yaml`**:
    Modify the `config.yaml` file to include your portfolio tickers, weights, and other risk parameters. Ensure the portfolio **Excel file** (`Portfolio.xlsm`) is available in the correct directory.

    ### Portfolio Excel File Configuration:
    - **Path**: Specify the path to the Excel file in `config.yaml`.
    - **Named Ranges**: Define the named ranges for **tickers**, **weights**, and **market values**. These ranges should each be a **1xN or Nx1 vector** (row or column vector with matching dimensions).

    Example configuration:
    ```yaml
    excel_path: ../Portfolio.xlsm  # Path to the portfolio Excel file
    sheet_name: Dashboard  # Name of the sheet containing portfolio data
    named_ranges:
      tickers: Portfolio_Tickers  # Named range for tickers in the portfolio
      weights: Portfolio_Weights  # Named range for portfolio weights
      market_values: Portfolio_MarketValues  # Named range for portfolio market values
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    Start the app using Streamlit:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. **Running the pipeline**:
    - From the **Streamlit interface**, you can choose to run the full pipeline or specific components (`full`, `risk`, or `factor`).
